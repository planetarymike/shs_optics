    "Conclusion: IUVS sees about 5-6 ph/s/kR @ Lyman alpha across 6 spatial rows (~0.085°)\n",

    "\n",
    "100ph / ((5-6 ph/s/kR)*4kR) = 4-5 s\n",
    "\n",
    "but this signal is probably spread out over a large range of wavelengths, detecting an individual component may be tricky. If we want SNR 10 on the 4th Doppler width from the Lyman alpha line center this would be \n",
    "\n",
    "0.0015 * 40 kR = 0.06 kR\n",
    "\n",
    "100ph / ((5-6 ph/s/kR)*0.06kR) = 320 - 400 s\n",

    "5 eV protons are traveling at 30 km / s. The resolution of an SHS with R=912,000 is ~0.3 km / s .\n",
    "\n",
    "If the 4 kR are spread evenly across 100 km / s, there would be 0.3/100 * 4kR = 0.012 kR in each resolution element of the spectrometer from this source. Obtaining SNR 10 on this component would require 5x longer than for 0.06 kR, 1600 - 2000 s .\n",
    "\n",
    "For 1kR proton aurora, intensities would be spread across 2x the speed of the solar wind (400 km/s), giving a reduction in signal of 4*4 = 16 and requiring 16x longer integrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The EMUS mirror is 35 mm x 61 mm (entrance pupil 30 mm x 20 mm), while IUVS is 13.3 mm x 20 mm. So an increase in sensitivity of 2.25 - 8.0 in the collecting area is possible; it would also be possible to increase the acceptance angle of the instrument by using different focal lengths for the telescope and collimator mirror. With an f ratio of 3(?) and an increase in mirror size of 8, we would get 24x the signal of IUVS, resulting in integration times of 60-80s for the 4 kR example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Things to consider: \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) can coaddition across different spectral resolution elements be performed? If so, SNR requirements decrease dramatically. Unclear how to do this with an interferogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Reducing the spectral resolution has quadratic effect on the signal obtained, if we can afford a 2x reduction in R then all integration times are divided by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Long integration times may cause burn-in on the detector, or result in cosmic ray artifacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) The entire detector must be downlinked or compressed to retain all photons and SNR --- potential data volume problems."
